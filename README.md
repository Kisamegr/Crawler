 - Count every individual trend reference for every user, and sort the users in an ascending order.
 - Divide the sorted user list into 4 teams, by calculating the Quartiles.
 - Pick 10 random users from each team, and record their activity for a 7-day period.
 - Extract information for these users (# tweets, # tweet replies, avg # of retweets, avg # of hashtags / tweet, % of tweets with hashtags, % tweets with urls, tweet source platform, etc...)
